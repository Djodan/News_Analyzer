1. In multi process events, its trying to process all the events first before placing any trades. 
The first event was processed and returned an actual value, but it didn't trade yet
The second event wasn't released yet and had to wait 2 minutes, also postponing the execution of the trade and for processing the other events
Rather than pausing the script, save the time somewhere and check against it similar to how we check against the time of the event. 


PREFERRED FLOW.
Thread multi events

ALTERNATIVE FLOW. 
Once the event is processed and the actual result has been captured, it should execute the trade first, before moving to the next event
If the event does not have a the actual value released yet, it should have the 2 min time saved and move on to the next event

No trades were executed at all
